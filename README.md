# Credit card fraud detection
I wanted to make some project with clustering algorithms and I found a large dataset on kaggle about credit card fraud.

The basic idea is to try to find some pattern on the transactions and be able to classify them as fraudulents or non fraudlents. The biggest challenge I can see now (without actually entering into the dataset) is that its higly unbalanced: this means that the dataset is composed of all the transactions of credit cards in two days but we have 497 fraud ones and 284,807 non fraud ones (roughly the 0.17% of all the dataset).

My original plan is to try different clustering algorithms to see if some of them perform better than the others and we can extract some conclusions about the dataset.
